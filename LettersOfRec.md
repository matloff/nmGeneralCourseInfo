Policy of My Writing Letters of Recommendation and Serving As a Job Reference
=============================================================================

Here I\'ll list my criteria for writings letters or serving as a job
reference.

I have sample letters at the end of this document.

Concerning job references
-------------------------

Almost always when I am approached by an employer in this regard, the
firm has already concluded that your technical qualities are good.
Instead, **they want to know about your character:** Are you ethical?
Reliable? A team player? Etc. I answer as best I can, given how well I
know you.

Concerning letters of recommendation for academic programs, scholarships and so on
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I tend to write detailed, very informative letters that may greatly
enhance the applicant\'s chances of being accepted. I have a very good
\"track record.\" However, I must make clear a number of points.

*Who is eligible?*

-   The high amount of detail is what makes my letters so successful.
    **So, if I don\'t know you well, I can\'t write a letter for you.**
    Accordingly, if I have zero recollection about you \-- you never
    made insightful comments in class, never attended office hours,
    never did research with me \-- I can\'t write a detailed,
    informative letter.
-   Note too that, in addition to the letter itself, most programs ask a
    series of multiple choice questions, and it looks bad if the
    recommender clicks \"Insufficient information to assess\" repeatedly
    on each one. I thus must unfortunately decline the student\'s
    request for a recommendation, **even if his/her exam grades were
    top-notch.**
-   On the other hand, If you took a course from me but got less than an
    A grade, I can still write a good letter, e.g. if you made
    insightful remarks in class or otherwise showed good potential.
-   Similarly, if you did research with me, coming up with good ideas
    and insights, and had a steady involvement with the project, I can
    write a good letter even if your GPA is not top-notch.
-   I like how the Stanford Stat Dept.
    [advises](https://statistics.stanford.edu/msadmissions/ms-admissions-faq)
    its grad applicants: Your letter writers \"\[should\] know you well
    through significant, direct involvement\...\[and will\] provide
    detailed anecdotes and examples to support their assertions\...\"

    A letter to any school that says, \"Ms. Brown got an A in my class,
    but unfortunately I don\'t remember her and can\'t say much else\"
    is rather useless to the admissions committee of the school.

*Restrictions and disclaimers:*

-   Recently our campus has been plagued with instructors who give
    amazingly liberal grades, e.g. 30% of an undergraduate class being
    given A+ grades. (Note: That\'s A+, not just A.) I know of several
    in my own department, and some in the Math Dept. Though I will not
    mention any specific such instructors individually, I will make note
    of the prevalence of extremely high grades in my letter, stating
    that UCD transcripts must in general be viewed in that light. I will
    make sure to add that grading in my own courses is not especially
    liberal.
-   **PLEASE NOTE THAT, WHILE I AGREE TO WRITE A LETTER FOR YOU, I WILL
    NOT DO SO FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS.** I will not write letters for
    programs that are merely jobs training in nature, as I find them
    exploitative and of low intellectual quality. Typically such
    programs (a) charge high fees, (b) have low admissions requirements
    and (c) overly emphasize employability of graduates of the program.
    In particular, I look very carefully at programs called \"Data
    Science\"; some are solid, but many are not.
-   I will not write \"Dear Sir or Madam\" letters. The letter must be
    sent to a specific university, employer or government agency.
-   Similarly, I will write in the letter, \"For the intended recipient
    only; this letter may not be transferred to another program,
    employer or agency without my permission.\"
-   Most programs ask the recommender to evaluate the applicant\'s
    character, in addition to her academic ability. Usually I have no
    reservations in that regard. But if I am aware of the student being
    dishonest or untrustworthy, I will be reluctant to write the letter,
    and will likely decline.
-   In writing a letter, I give the full record, including dropped
    quizzes. This is important, as the quizzes are the only written
    record I have on your work on an individual basis; as you know, the
    rest is all team-based (though I discuss these too).

*Please note the following:*

-   I will need you to supply me with a list of schools/programs/letter
    deadlines. If you later add a program or delete one, you are
    required to notify me.
-   Please list matloff\@cs.ucdavis.edu as my e-mail address, not
    nsmatloff\@ucdavis.edu. Otherwise I may not be able to log in to the
    admissions portal to submit your letter.
-   It is your responsibility to make sure the letters were received.
-   I think a limit of 9-10 letters (multiple programs at the same
    school count as multiple letters) is reasonable. I may extend this
    if you can make a strong case for it.
-   Do not give me supplemental information, e.g. a CV, and you need not
    meet with me. I want my letter to tell the admissions committees
    **what I know about you**, rather than duplicate information they
    will have in your application. Of course, if you wish to meet with
    me for advice on grad school, I\'m happy to give it.

Please let me know if you have any questions. By the way, below are
redacted past examples of actual letters I wrote. Of course, some were
for exceptionally outstanding students, so don\'t worry; I do write
letters for \"very good but not exceptional\" students, as you\'ll see.

## Sample Letters

These are real letters, with names and some other information redacted
to ensure that the identity of the student is not revealed. (I may place
a similarly redacted summary of your letter there too.)

**Letter:**

> I\'m delighted to write this letter recommending X. I\'ve known him
> since \[date\], when he enrolled in my course ECS Y on the topic of Z,
> and he also did a great job in a research project with me.
>
> X has taken two CS courses from me\...These courses go in two
> different directions, the first in mathematics and the second in
> programming. Thus it is significant that he earned A+ grades in both
> courses\...
>
> X\'s exam grades placed him as one of the top two students in the
> first course, in an enrollment of about 70. The other top student was
> a graduate student, and had had previous exposure to the material in
> his undergraduate days\...In fact, there was another graduate student
> in the course, actually in a math program rather than CS, who did not
> do quite as well as X\...
>
> In the second course, X had the best exam record by far among the
> approximately 50 enrolled, including one graduate student whose
> research area is the subject of this course!\...
>
> I gave Extra Credit for those homework teams whose programs are among
> the three fastest in the class\... and X\'s team (of three students)
> was usually in that winner\'s circle\...
>
> X is soft-spoken but speaks with confidence, and made a number of
> deeply insightful comments during lectures.
>
> I had funding for a project whose goal is to develop software that
> does W. In hiring students to work on the project, X immediately came
> to mind, and I was pleased when he enthusiastically accepted my offer.
> Software is more than writing code; the overall structures and design
> can be a real challenge to do well, and X really excelled here. His
> code is still being used today, well after he left the project for
> grad school, and I continue to appreciate his first-rate design, which
> makes modification easy.
>
> In short, X is a truly outstanding student.

**Letter:**

> I am delighted to write this letter in support of T, whom I know quite
> well. He is a top talent, and is a pleasure to work with. I first knew
> T when he was a student in my course \[Z\] Since then he was worked on
> two research projects with me.
>
> T was the best student in the course Z. I give weekly quizzes in lieu
> of midterm and final exams. The quiz problems range in difficulty from
> the straightforward to the challenging. They do NOT measure rote
> memory. formula-plugging and so on. T had the top quiz average in the
> course, out of about 50 students.
>
> T\'s performance in my class of course is quite impressive, but to me
> his strongest recommendation for grad school is his invaluable
> contributions to two research projects that I\'ve led\...
>
> It\'s one thing to write software with an agreed-upon goal in mind,
> but quite another to develop good goals in the first place. This is
> precisely what T did\...\[showing\] excellent creativity and insight.
> The project group submitted a paper to \[conference Q\]\...The paper
> was accepted, and T gave the talk, which was very well done. Actually,
> the session chair took T aside later and told him that his talk was
> the best of the session! Since the other speakers were professors and
> graduate students, this was quite a compliment.

**Letter:**

> Y is one of the most remarkable young people I\'ve met in my long
> career in university teaching.
>
> Y took two courses from me: ECS 132, an undergraduate course in
> probability and statistics for computer science students in Fall Y,
> and then ECS 256, a graduate-level course in the same area, in Winter
> Z\....She earned A+ grades in both courses, but that tells only part
> of the story.
>
> I have open-source, self-authored textbooks for every course I teach.
> In ECS 132, Y stood out even before our term started, as she came to
> me beforehand to give me a list of a dozen or so typos she had found
> in my book! One doesn\'t encounter students with such initiative every
> day. She then of course did extremely well in the class. I give weekly
> quizzes (no other exams), and Y had the highest average quiz grade in
> my class of over 60 students. This means, among other things, that she
> even outdid several graduate students from Statistics.
>
> Y continued her stellar work in the 256 class. Of course, most of
> those enrolled were graduate students, and yet Y, as an undergraduate,
> outscored almost all of them. And, as a \"bonus,\" she was the only
> one of the 30+ students, both American and international, who knew the
> meaning of the word *triage* when I happened to bring it up one day in
> class. Pretty nice for a non-native speaker of English!
>
> My courses stress genuine insight; there is nothing of the
> \"formula-plugging\" nature whatsoever. Those quizzes include some
> quite challenging problems. For Y to shine in such a setting tells me
> that she will do top work in graduate school. She will make a great
> research student, and would serve as an excellent teaching assistant.
> I give her my top recommendation.

**Letter:**

> X has taken three courses from me, first a computer organization
> class, then one in parallel processing and finally one in scripting
> languages. He earned grades of A- and B+ in those first two courses,
> and will likely get a similar grade in the third (which I am currently
> preparing grades for)\...
>
> I give heavy weight to group work, with students doing the programming
> assignments, the last quiz and the project in their groups of three or
> four students. X has tended to do B work on my quizzes and exams.
> However, he works well in his groups, and I\'ve observed that he
> actually serves as a natural leader in his groups.
>
> The final weekly quiz consists of in-class programming in groups, with
> the code sent to me via the Internet at the end of class. In the
> parallel processing course, there were about a dozen groups yet X\'s
> group was one of only two to actually get their code to work, in a
> difficult problem.
>
> X is outgoing and well-liked. He\'d make an excellent TA.

**Letter:**

> I\'m delighted write this letter recommending Z.
>
> I\'ve known Z for a little more than a year now. He took my class in
> \[year, quarter\], and he and I have interacted quite a bit since
> then. We\'ve talked a lot about various subjects, including societal
> issues\...
>
> The course Z took from me was ECS 50, a lower-division class on
> computer systems. Most students regard my version of the course to be
> quite difficult, as it requires analysis. Up to that point, they\'ve
> just taken programming classes, and the rote-memory types do poorly. Z
> earned an A+ grade in the course.
>
> I\'ve not observed Z in mathematical settings, but I see that he
> earned an A in a number theory class in the Math. Dept\...
>
> Z\'s salient quality is his earnestness. He is keenly interested in
> the workings of society, and wants to Do Good, contribute to the
> world\...
>
> On a personal level, Z is highly articulate\...and is outgoing but not
> flashy.
>
> I do believe that Z will make his mark on the world, and I strongly
> recommend him.

**Letter:**

> I am delighted to recommend Y for the position of \[student leadership
> position\]. I have known Y for about a year now, both as her professor
> and her faculty adviser. I think quite highly of her.
>
> Y is a very exhuberant and outgoing individual, unusual among
> engineering students. She is quite friendly, very popular among her
> classmates, truly enjoying interaction among people.
>
> Y is very much a \"go-getter.\" A good example of this concerns her
> participation in the Society of Women Engineers on campus. Y has
> worked very hard to recruit more membership into the organization. As
> someone who has himself worked very hard to get more women into
> engineering, I consider Y\'s work here of great value.
>
> I am quite sure that Y is headed for a fine career involving
> leadership in some form, either as an engineering manager or maybe
> even as an entrepeneur herself. Thus she has exactly the personal
> skills appropriate for this position, and I highly recommend her for
> it.

**Letter:**

> \...R earned an A+ in the class. He was one of the top two students in
> terms of examination scores (he and the other student were essentially
> tied, substantially above the rank-3 student), and made excellent,
> insightful comments in class.
>
> The term project is done in groups of three or four students. The one
> submitted by R and his two partners was truly outstanding, possibly
> the best I\'ve seen in the dozen or so times I\'ve taught the
> class\...
>
> All of R\'s team for the project were top-notch students. (One was the
> one he was tied with for top exam scores.) But they all contributed
> equally to the project, according to the statement I required of all
> students, and I am quite sure that is true.
>
> R\'s research with me has involved \[software topic\]\... it appears
> so far that our package\...is substantially faster and easier to
> program in than various alternatives.

**Letter:**

> I am delighted to recommend W for doctoral study. W took ECS 132 from
> me, a course in probability and statistics for computer science
> students.
>
> ECS 132 is a very difficult course to teach, because many
> undergraduate computer science students lack math intuition, a crucial
> skill for both success in the course and the ability to apply the
> material in one\'s career and indeed one\'s life. I hope it is clear
> from my phrasing here that I consider this course to be of very high
> importance\...
>
> I must say that this will be an unusual letter. Did W get absolutely
> top exam grades in my course? No, just a respectable B+, though with
> two or three of his grades on my weekly quizzes being A+. Has he done
> research with me? No. Do I know him exceptionally well on a personal
> level? No. But in spite of all that, I believe that he would do quite
> well as a PhD student.
>
> W did visit me in my office on a number of occasions. But instead of
> asking for hints on the homework, as most students do in my office, he
> asked me a number of conceptual questions about the course material
> \-\-- penetrating questions. I remember being taken aback on several
> occasions by the depth of what he was asking. He had extraorinary
> insight. It is on this basis that I rate W quite highly. I realize
> that this is an intangible, but I have strong confidence in my
> statement.
>
> W told me, when he was in my course, that this was his second
> Bachelor\'s degree, the first being one in \[the humanities\]. How\'s
> that for shifting gears! I would guess that it took him a while to
> adjust to the engineering \"culture\" in taking exams, hence the
> disparity between the keen insight he showed in my office and the
> generally more modest level of his performance in my exams.
>
> On a personal level, W is unusually quiet and serious\...He is quite
> well-spoken, though, and would make a good TA. And if he were in my
> own graduate program, I\'d be happy to take him on as a research
> student.
>
> This is an unusual case, one that in my opinion calls for unusual
> assessment. I definitely recommend W for your program.

**Letter:**

> I know L much better than I know most of my students. He took two
> classes from me\...and we\'ve had a number of conversations about
> computer science and statistics.
>
> Many students have excellent grades but only shallow insight. L is not
> like that at all. He has excellent insight, and is definitely a
> Thinker. It has been a pleasure to know him. I would be thrilled to
> have him as a research student.

**Letter:**

> G was a student in my ECS 132 class\...a calculus-based course in
> probability and statistics for computer science students\...Most
> students find the course difficult, at least in my version of it, as
> they sorely lack mathematical intuition.
>
> G earned a high A grade in the course\...The weekly quizzes are
> challenging, and her average score was easily among the top five or
> six among the 80+ students enrolled.
>
> \[It\] is especially noteworthy that in Quiz 4, G was the only student
> in the entire class to correctly solve one of the problems, which
> dealt with recurrence times in Markov chains\...
>
> G later worked on an undergraduate reserch project with me, developing
> open-source software. The algorithm is quite intricate, and writing it
> required an especially high talent in abstraction. Her programming
> skill is absolutely first-rate, and she contributed many ideas to the
> project.

**Letter:**

> \[A few weeks ago\] C approached me in Fall 2021 about the possibility
> of doing research with me. I asked her to meet with me to discuss
> it\.... We talked about the \[research\] problem, touching on various
> stat topics, such as sample size, regression models, linear algebra
> and the R language. It was clear to me that she had learned well, and
> unusually for undergraduates, she had retained it. She followed my
> discourse on the general \[research\] area well, and immediately
> understood the new methods that I suggested she and I might explore.
>
> And C\'s unusually high level of enthusiasm evaporated any reluctance
> I may have had about taking on one more student. It was clear to me
> that she not only would devote the time needed, but would do so with
> great energy and a high degree of intellectual curiosity. There were
> many instances in which I mentioned some side topic, on which she
> immediately wanted to learn more. In short, the project would be an
> enjoyable and very productive collaboration, so I happily accepted her
> as my research student. It has been a pleasure meeting with her in our
> weekly interactions.
>
> The project is empirical in nature, not theory, and I have not had her
> in a class. Thus I cannot comment on C\'s math skills on a theoretical
> level. She has shown good intuition, such as in the discussion she and
> I had back in October on overfitting. Of course, intuition is key to
> the project.

**Letter:**

> It\'s a pleasure to write this letter recommending R, an outstanding
> student.
>
> I\'ve known R for almost a year now, first as a student in my course
> X, and later in his participation in a research project with me, which
> is still ongoing today. I will focus mainly on the latter, as I\'ve
> come to know him quite well in that endeavor, during which I\'ve
> developed the highest respect for him.
>
> R earned an A- grade in the course. That put him in the upper-third of
> that class, which is impressive in that it is one of the best groups
> of students I\'ve ever had in terms of student participation during
> lectures. There were many lively, quite enjoyable class discussions on
> the nature and \`\`philosophy\'\' of machine learning, something I
> rarely see in our students. (R himself was usually not involved in
> those discussions \-- he preferred to discuss with me during office
> hours \-\-- but the point is that it was an especially strong group of
> students.)
>
> But where R has really shined is the research project. Actually, this
> started rather by accident. Another student was starting the project,
> and while I was meeting with her, R happened to drop by. On the spur
> of the moment, I asked him if he would like to join, as he had
> indicated interest in doing research. He did join, and he and the
> other student immediately started doing excellent work. The other
> student was in her last quarter, and after she graduated, R has been
> working by himself. It has been a delight to work with him, and I look
> forward to our weekly meeings.
>
> The project involves use of machine learning for Y\... The key skills
> needed are strong coding ability and keen geometric intuition, both of
> which R possesses. He has worked mainly on his own, with very little
> direction from me, and has come up with good ideas.
>
> At this writing, R and I have a paper on the results\... That paper
> includes some empirical investigation of the method, with some
> promising results, and he is now doing broader and more thorough
> experiments. We hope to submit this broader work to a strong journal
> or conference within the coming months.
>
> R began his career here at Davis as a non-STEM major, then transferred
> to Computer Science. He has earned A or A- grades in all his courses
> in my department, mostly from some of our more challenging and
> demanding faculty.
>
> R speaks completely fluent, American-accented English. Though he is an
> international student, I would guess he spent some time in American
> schools during his formative years. He also is outgoing and has a kind
> demeanor. He is the type of person who earns high respect from his
> peers. If called upon, he will make a popular, very effective TA, and
> will do quite well in presenting research talks as a grad student. In
> summary, R is bright, energetic and articulate. He will make a fine
> graduate student, especially in research.
